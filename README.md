Predicting Hospital Readmission for Diabetic Patients Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis of KNN, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, and RandomForest
Hospital readmissions for diabetic patients significantly burden healthcare systems and patients alike. This study aims to develop a predictive model for hospital readmission using the Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset. Machine learning classifiers including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest were trained and evaluated. Feature selection was conducted using mutual information and variance threshold methods. The dataset was balanced using undersampling technique to address class imbalance. Evaluation was performed using 5-fold cross-validation. Naives Bayes (Gaussian) achieved the highest accuracy 54%, suggesting its strong potential in hospital readmission prediction.
